Here is the API I used: https://rapidapi.com/weatherbit/api/weather/playground/apiendpoint_35eca576-3eb8-4974-810f-12dbdf1a35ba

I set the parameters to look for weather alerts in Logan. If there is an alert, it will display the first one. If there is not, it will display a message that there is not currently an alert for the Logan area.
